Arrange, position, align, place, repeat, array, and distribute geometric elements of different sizes inside a cuboid container *(for example a building, room, or car park)* or along a curve *(e.g. a road, train track, or linear structure)*.

*Typical distribution tools only work with elements of uniform size but this library follows the concepts of [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) allowing complete flexibility to arrange elements of any size together.*
