📈 **Lineweights.Curves**

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-critical)

Curve interpolation and spline geometry for the Elements library.

*Typical architectural and urban planning software is limited to the rigidity of the grid street plan favoured by the US but elsewhere in the world the built environment has evolved more fluidly and pleasingly following the curvature of natural features. This library adds the missing curves that are essential to masterplanning.*

🏘 **Lineweights.Masterplanning**

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-critical)

Automate the creation of residential capacity studies and masterplans.

*Typical masterplanning tools have strict limitations, working only with straight roads, cuboid buildings, or limited unit types but this library builds on the author's experience developing residential masterplans in architectural practice ensuring that it is flexible enough to work how you work.*
