## Geometrician

Geometrician is an application to execute and visualise the results of geometric workflows using Hypar's Elements library.

The application can run client-side directly in the browser using [Blazor WebAssembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-6.0#blazor-server), or as a [Blazor Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-6.0#blazor-server). Soon it will also be available as a [Blazor Hybrid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-6.0#blazor-hybrid) app using either .NET MAUI or WPF, and via a command line interface.

*Live demos of the WebAssembly App:*

*→ [Production (main branch)](https://geometrician.io/)*

*→ [Staging (develop branch)](https://next.geometrician.io/)*

## Lineweights

Lineweights is a collection of modular libraries for automating architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) workflows.

*The components are written in C# using Hypar's Elements library. They are designed to be cross-platform for use in standard industry software and cloud platforms such as Hypar, Dynamo, Revit, Grasshopper, and Rhino.*

*Rather than solving specific AEC automation problems the intention of these libraries is to provide a base from which developers can build upon to solve AEC automation problems quicker, easier, and more reliably. The libraries are heavily documented, unit tested, and with specific samples demonstrating the use.*
